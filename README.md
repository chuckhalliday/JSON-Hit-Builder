This a music composition application, conceptualized while playing with Sonic Pi (a live coding music program written with Ruby for the uninitiated)

I built out the structure for three concurrent instruments that trigger midi hits according to time-value arrays and decided that it would be cool to have an application that builds these arrays to match each other based on rhythmic logic and/or genre

The algorithm for this functionality is still a work in progress, but the concept has gradually evolved into a web program that generates full song structures!
