# Node Composer

Welcome to the Node Composer Repo, a web application dedicated to music composition and exploration. You can experience it live at [node-composer.vercel.app](https://node-composer.vercel.app). This project was inspired by my exploration of Sonic Pi, a live coding music program written in Ruby.

## Overview

I initially designed this application to facilitate the creation of musical compositions by building arrays for concurrent instruments, triggered by MIDI hits from enum strings based on time-value arrays. The idea was to have an application that constructs these arrays to synchronize based on rhythmic logic and/or genre. Opting for JavaScript, my language of choice, I took the opportunity to delve into TypeScript, appreciating its bug avoidance and code navigation benefits.

## Evolution of the Project

Recognizing the challenges of managing multiple languages, I shifted towards reverse-engineering key functionalities of Sonic Pi. After overcoming various puzzles and deploying a basic drum machine front-end, I discovered the exciting capability of sending MIDI directly to a local DAW from a live URL in the browser.

*Note: The current MIDI functionality is tailored for Mac users. To replicate full functionality, ensure you have three buses set up on your IAC driverâ€”Bus 1 for drums, Bus 2 for bass, and Bus 3 for chords. Recognized buses will appear in your console when you click "Use MIDI."*

## Core Features

The core functionality centers around the "groove" algorithm, a work in progress that has expanded into a web program capable of generating complete song structures. Upon initial load, a random groove is assigned to the bass, which combines and subdivides to generate complementary chord and drum grooves. These grooves are then processed through a series of functions, assigning note values based on a matrix of tonal music theory concepts.

## Song Structure Generation

The application randomly assigns a BPM and overall length within a range of 3-5 minutes. The resulting parts (verse, chorus, bridge) are distributed to fill the established time, creating a tree in the Redux store. Users can either replace the tree entirely by customizing initial values in a form or alter parts note by note in the rendered components.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this application is to serve as a comprehensive starting point and canvas for your sonic ideas. By automating the setup of tracks, it allows you to focus on infusing your art with soul rather than getting bogged down with building everything out note by note.

## Ongoing Development

The project is a work in progress, with continuous updates introducing new features and addressing bugs. I welcome all suggestions to enhance this utility and make it a more powerful tool for instant ideation of tunes.

*Happy composing!*
