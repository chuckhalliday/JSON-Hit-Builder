node-composer.vercel.app

This a music composition application, conceptualized while playing with Sonic Pi (writing with Ruby)

I built out the structure for three concurrent instruments that trigger midi hits according to time value arrays and decided that I wanted an application that builds these arrays into "grooves" that match each other based on rhythmic logic and/or genre

The algorithm for this is still a work in progress, but the concept has evolved into a web program that generates complete song structures!
